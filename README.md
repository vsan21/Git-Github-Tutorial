# Simple Git/Github Tutorial

### Why? 
The idea for making this came out of our own desire to find a simple tutorial site that would teach us how to use Git & GitHub in our own workflow.
### How?
To create this site, we used Express as our framework, HTML, CSS, EJS, and JavaScript for the front-end, and Node.js and Mongodb for the back-end. We also used Nodemailer on the server side to send a resource link through our short form.
### Who? 
We created this site for people like ourselves who have a basic knowledge of GitHub and are looking for a quick guide they can reference when working in different work flows. We created guides for 3 different work flows: ‘Solo’ for when you’re working on your own project, ‘Group’ for when you’re working on a group project working off of one master branch, and ‘Collaboration’ for when you’re working on a group project or refactoring code from a forked repo.
